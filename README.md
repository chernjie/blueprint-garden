# Blueprint Garden  
*A living archive of home-improvement designs, system plans, architectural explorations, and experimental ideas.*

---

## 🌿 Purpose  
**Blueprint Garden** documents the evolution of a multi-disciplinary home ecosystem. It integrates:  
- Design sketches (2D + 3D)  
- CAD / PlantUML diagrams  
- Architecture & system-engineering notes  
- Renovation plans and decision-rationale  
- Gardening layouts, landscape systems and soil/irrigation experiments  
- Brainstorm sessions, prototypes and lessons learned  

This repository isn’t a static collection—it’s a workspace where ideas grow, iterate and connect.

---

## 🧭 Guiding Principles  
- **Architect first, build second.** Start with intent, then execution.  
- **Systems over fragments.** Projects are interconnected, not isolated.  
- **Version everything.** Plans evolve; documentation captures why and how.  
- **Exploration is the point.** Creativity and rigor are equally valid.  
- **Public-friendly.** No personal or private data; everything is appropriate for a public portfolio.

## 🧪 Experiments  
Sandbox for testing:  
- Mulch chemistry & compost dynamics  
- Soil-structure amendments  
- Micro-climate manipulation  
- Light, shade and irrigation trials  
- Long-term durability studies  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Tech  
- **PlantUML** for system/structural diagrams  
- **Blender / SketchUp / FreeCAD** for 3D modeling  
- **Markdown** for documentation  
- **Codex** for ideation, iteration and refinement workflows  

---

## 🚀 Goals  
- Develop a long-term knowledge system capturing architectural intent, technical decisions, and build sequences.  
- Create high-fidelity planning before breaking ground.  
- Maintain a digital twin of the property ecosystem (home + garden + built systems).  
- Demonstrate technical and systems thinking applied to real-world built environments.

## 🌱 Closing Note  
**Blueprint Garden** is more than a collection of plans—it’s a narrative of transformation.  
By turning ideas into structured systems, the home becomes a platform for growth, learning and creativity.

_Thanks for stopping by. Ideas welcome._
