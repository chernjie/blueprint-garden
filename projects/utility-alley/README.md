## 📸 Visual Reference (Summary of Concepts)

1. **Initial Photo:** Narrow passage behind shed with concrete base and fence.
2. **Rain Cover Installed:** Full-length tarp protection completed.
3. **Rendered Concept:** Metal rack with labeled bins and tarps mounted above.

## 🏗️ Design Principles

* Maximize vertical space (ceiling to floor utilization)
* Prioritize accessibility (heavier items at floor level)
* Protect against moisture (elevated storage & sealed bins)
* Maintain clear walking path (minimum 15" wide)
* Use modular systems for future flexibility

---

## 🔖 Naming Convention

**Utility Alley** follows the same naming logic as other garden and property sections:

* **Drybed12** → Dry herb garden bed (12 ft)
* **North8** → 40 ft wall area facing northwest
* **Utility Alley** → 3×10 ft storage corridor behind shed

---

## 🧩 Integration with Surroundings

* Shares boundary with **Drybed12 (dry herb garden)**
* Hidden from main view, preserving yard aesthetics
* Positioned for easy access from backyard and sunroom

---

## 🧠 Summary

Utility Alley transforms an underutilized gap into a functional micro-storage shed. Through thoughtful zoning, vertical optimization, and moisture-safe organization, it supports tool and material management without encroaching on living or garden space.

> Designed for practicality, longevity, and subtle integration with the existing property layout.
