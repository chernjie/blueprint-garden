## Legend & Protocol

* **Coordinates:** `(x,y)` feet. Origin at driveway trench south end. `x` increases east, `y` increases north. Ranges are `x1,y1 → x2,y2`.
* **Size:** `width × depth` (width = east–west).
* **Facing:** Direction the section **faces** (its open exposure), *not* where you stand.
* **Walls:** Note height only when relevant (shade/reflection).
* **Soil tags:** `DG/sand` (decomposed granite/sandy), `loam` (deeper native), etc.

## Sections — Details & Prompts

### Driveway Trench

* **Position/Size:** `0,0 → 1,20` (20 × 1); orientation N–S; faces south by slope.
* **Sun/Water:** Full sun; heat reflected by concrete; no adjacent wall.
* **Plants:** Kurrajong/Bottle tree at S tip; common mallow at N tip (tolerates light tire traffic).
* **Ideas/Prompts:**

  * Low profile, heat‑tolerant edibles: thyme strip, chives, bunching onions (edge), creeping oregano.
  * Irrigation: single drip line, 1 GPH emitters @ 12–18".
* **Tasks:** define permanent mulch; trial 2 ft pollinator patch at N half.

---

### Drybed12

* **Facing:** East; **Wall:** 5' fence (shade after midday).
* **Soil:** DG/sand base; upgraded with compost; wicking/retention concept; added extra 2×6 frame.
* **Sun:** Good AM/early PM; shaded late PM.
* **Use:** Water‑wise bed for aesthetics + edibles.
* **Prompts:**

  * Confirm reservoir depth (4–6") and perforated pipe layout; add fill tube & overflow.
  * Plant list (east aspect): calendula, dwarf marigold, tatsoi/lettuce (cool), bush beans (warm), compact peppers; calla lily (container nearby).
* **Tasks:** top with 2" mulch; drip line schedule; monitor salt buildup; adjust media with bark/compost 60/40.

---

### Sunny Front Left

* **Position/Size:** `0,25 → -10,28` (10 × 3).
* **Facing/Wall:** Faces **south**; 2‑story wall ~25' (long winter sun window).
* **Role:** Front‑of‑house eye‑catcher; in‑ground gardenia present (blooming).
* **Sun:** Full; winter even better; summer heat reflected.
* **Prompts:**

  * Rotational color with perennials favored: salvia ‘Mystic Spires’, dwarf daylily, gaillardia, lavender stoechas, echinacea; seasonal annuals to plug.
  * Gardenia care: light acid feed, even moisture, iron chelate PRN.
* **Tasks:** define 12‑mo rotation for Front Porch Planter synergy; check spider‑mite pressure.

---

### North8

* **Position/Size:** `0,25 → 35,50` (~40 × 1.5).
* **Facing/Wall:** Northwest; 5' fence.
* **Sun:** Little AM; strong midday/evening in summer.
* **Soil:** Raised/composted; improved after potatoes.
* **What worked:** cherry tomatoes, Marvel of Peru, potatoes (summer), some succulents.
* **What struggled:** mint, okra, bush beans.
* **Plans:** Five star‑jasmine vines as structural green; edible companions underneath (calendula, shiso, lettuces in cool season). Trellis choices: poly mason twine zig‑zag vs independent 1×2 structure 18" off fence.
* **Tasks:** finalize trellis method; plant edible under‑story strips; schedule summer irrigation.

---

### Herbal Strip (+ Compost Zone)

* **Position/Size:** `-7,70 → 0,60` (12 × 3).
* **Facing/Wall:** Southwest; 5' wall; **Soil:** DG/sand shared with Drybed12.
* **Existing plants:** *Camellia sinensis*, Chinese yam, onions (incl. walking), tiny basil & chili, compost bin; adjacent hyacinth bean arch.
* **Sun:** Minimal AM; strong PM.
* **Prompts:**

  * Tea camellia rehab (iron, pH ~5.5–6, morning rinse to deter mites).
  * Companion herbs: rosemary (upright), sage (managed), lemongrass, dill/edamame/okra trials (seasonal).
* **Tasks:** define compost workflow; maintain 2" leaf mulch; Maxsea schedule.

---

### Orchard Section

* **Position:** `0,60 → 7,50` along SW wall (diagonal run).
* **Soil:** Deeper native (not DG/sand).
* **Microclimate:** Hot reflective wall = heat sink.
* **Line‑up (S→N):** Pink rose → **Pomegranate** → **Calamansi** (sets fruit mid‑year, harvest green → orange through winter) → **Guava** (prune leaning branch) → empty slot → **Banana**.
* **Prompts:**

  * Use the wall heat for containerized subtropicals in the empty slot: passionfruit, dragon fruit, or dwarf mango; or fig in 10–15 gal grow bag.
  * Thin fruit clusters; balanced citrus feed; reflective mulch for late‑ripening citrus.
* **Tasks:** prune guava for clearance; set compost‑trench under the void area; add one 15‑gal container trial.

---

### Patio Planters (on posts)

* **Position:** `10,40 → 12,44` near east‑facing patio posts.
* **Configuration:** Per post: **upper** 24"×8" (small), **lower** 28"×12" (medium).
* **Planting (post #1):**

  * **Upper:** onion + ginger + **dill** (sprouted)
  * **Lower:** fish mint + **11 garlic** cloves
* **Prompts:**

  * Trial scallions (Evergreen Hardy White) in edges; rotate leafy greens in cool season; shiso and calendula as companions.
  * Coffee‑grounds: fine for fish mint; use lightly for others.
* **Tasks:** add drip tees; monthly fish‑emulsion for foliage crops.

---

### Front Porch Planter (wooden, 4 slots)

* **Microclimate:** More sun in **winter** (low angle); shaded in **summer** by soffit.
* **Current rotation:** kalanchoe, Gerbera daisy (intermittent bloom), small fig, unknown succulent.
* **Strategy:** High‑contrast bloom rotations with mostly perennials; integrate gardenias if they perk up; pineapple sage as a movable color/scent plug.
* **Prompts:**

  * Winter: paperwhites, cyclamen, hellebore;
  * Spring: dwarf snapdragon, osteospermum, nemesia;
  * Summer: calibrachoa, dwarf salvia, angelonia;
  * Autumn: violas, mums, alyssum underplanting.
* **Tasks:** define a quarterly swap schedule; keep two backup bloomers in nursery row.

---

### Bougainvillea Wall

* **Spans:** Two runs (~10' each).
* **First run (L→R):** 2' star‑jasmine panel → 8' pink rose → potted red‑orange rose → hibiscus.
* **Second run (L→R):** 2' star‑jasmine panel → 2'×3' gardenia → single star jasmine → **5' bougainvillea** → **Angel statue** (90° turn into North8).
* **Sun:** Hot, reflective; excellent for bloomers; monitor mites.
* **Tasks:** train jasmine panels; IPM for aphids/thrips/spider mites; mulch bases.

---

## Inputs & Care Cheat‑Sheet

* **Fertilizers:**

  * Maxsea AP/Bloom/Acid — alternate monthly by crop needs (Acid for gardenia/camellia/citrus; Bloom for roses/bougainvillea; AP for veggies).
  * Epsom salt **only** if Mg deficiency confirmed (interveinal chlorosis on older leaves).
  * Coffee grounds: thin top‑dress for acid‑lovers (gardenia, camellia, citrus); avoid thick mats.
* **Pests:** Spider mites (wash + neem/soap; rotate; keep humidity pulses); thrips on flax; earwigs in squash flowers; DE as soil ring only.
* **Compost:** Tumbler + leaf‑mold; can use worn linens as **weed‑block** or **wicking liner** in new beds.

---

## Open Decisions

* North8 trellis method (twine vs independent frame).
* Orchard empty slot: choose edible container crop for the heat wall.
* Front Porch Planter perennial rotation shortlist (confirm colors).
* Drybed12 reservoir depth + emitter map.
